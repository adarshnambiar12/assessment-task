# Frontend Developer Intern Assignment

## Overview
This project was created as part of the Frontend Developer Intern assessment. The goal was to develop a responsive website using Astro with React and Tailwind CSS, following the provided design reference and requirements.

## Tech Stack
- **Astro** (configured with React)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility based styling)
- **React** (for component-based development)
- **Framer Motion** (for implementing the animations)

## Approach

### Initial Setup
1. **Learning Astro**:
   - Since my prior experience was with **Create React App** and **Vite**, I started by understanding the basics of Astro. This included its file structure, routing system, and how to integrate frameworks like React.

2. **Configuring Astro**:
   - Configured Astro to work seamlessly with React and Tailwind CSS.
   - Ensured the Tailwind setup was optimized for responsiveness and styling.

### Development Process
1. **Component Identification**:
   - Analyzed the provided design reference.
   - Identified components such as the navigation bar, hero section, and carousel.

2. **Building Components**:
   - Created individual components using React.
   - Styled components with Tailwind CSS, focusing on modular and responsive design principles.

3. **Routing Setup**:
   - Configured routes for `About`, `Product`, and `Contact` pages.

4. **Responsiveness**:
   - Tested the website on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness.

5. **Carousel Integration**:
   - Added a carousel and customized its design and functionality to match the reference design as closely as possible.

## Challenges
1. **Design**:
    - Faced challenges with matching the exact font since it was sourced from Canva.
    - Used a similar-looking font as a replacement while keeping the design in mind.

2. **Learning Curve**:
  - Had to quickly adapt to Astroâ€™s framework, which was new to me, but successfully implemented the requirements.

3. **Testing**:
   - Ensured all components were well-styled and consistent.
   - Focused on accessibility and clean, maintainable code.
   - Conducted manual testing to validate functionality and responsiveness.
